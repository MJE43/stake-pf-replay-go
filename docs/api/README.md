## Architecture

### GraphQL vs REST

The Stake API uses a hybrid approach:

**GraphQL** (`/_api/graphql`):
- Account operations (balance queries, seed rotation)
- Vault deposits/withdrawals
- User profile data
- Structured query language for complex data fetching

**REST** (`/_api/casino/*`):
- All game betting operations
- Simple POST-based endpoints
- Game-specific paths (dice, limbo, hilo, etc.)
- Consistent request/response patterns

### When Each is Used

**Use GraphQL for:**
- Querying user account state
- Managing seeds (provably fair)
- Vault operations
- Multi-field data retrieval

**Use REST for:**
- Placing bets
- Game actions (hit, stand, reveal, etc.)
- Cashout operations
- Active bet queries

### Authentication

All endpoints require the `x-access-token` header:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
x-access-token: <session-cookie-value>
```

Token is extracted from the `session` cookie in the browser. See [Authentication and Utilities](./authentication-and-utilities.md) for details.

### Base URL Pattern

```
https://{domain}/_api/{endpoint-type}/{...}
```

- `{domain}`: `stake.com`, `stake.us`, or mirror domains
- `{endpoint-type}`: `graphql` or `casino`

---

## Key Insights

Important discoveries from the reverse engineering process:

### 1. Rate Limiting Behavior

**Observation**: HTTP 403 responses indicate rate limiting.

**Handling**:
- Retry after 2-second delay
- Do not retry more than 3 times consecutively
- Consider backing off if 403s persist

**Code pattern**:
```javascript
if (err.status === 403) {
  setTimeout(() => retryBet(), 2000);
}
```

**Implementation note**: The extension retries indefinitely on 403. A production Go client should implement max retry limits.

---

### 2. Error Handling Patterns

**Common error types**:

| Error Type | Meaning | Handling |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `parallelCasinoBet` | Multiple bets in flight | Silent retry, don't log |
| `existingGame` | Active game already exists | Fetch active bet state |
| `notFound` | Bet/game not found | Treat as complete (cashout done) |
| `insignificantBet` | Bet too small | Treat as complete |
| `insufficientBalance` | Not enough funds | Stop betting, alert user |

**Key pattern**: Errors are returned in `errors` array, not via HTTP status codes:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "errorType": "existingGame",
      "message": "You already have an active game"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation note**: Always check `json.errors` before processing `json.data`.

---

### 3. Identifier Requirements

**All bet requests require a random identifier**:
- **Length**: 21 characters
- **Charset**: `_-0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_-`
- **Purpose**: Prevents replay attacks, ensures request uniqueness

**Implementation**:
```go
const charset = "_-0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_-"

func randomString(length int) string {
    b := make([]byte, length)
    for i := range b {
        b[i] = charset[rand.Intn(len(charset))]
    }
    return string(b)
}

func betIdentifier() string {
    return randomString(21)
}
```

**Critical**: Generate a new identifier for EVERY bet request.

---

### 4. Multi-Round Game State Management

**Games with multi-round state**: HiLo, Mines, Blackjack

**State tracking requirements**:

1. **Active bet object** (`currentBet`):
   - Contains full game state
   - Updated after each action
   - Persists until game ends

2. **Cashout flag** (`cashout_done`):
   - `false` = game in progress
   - `true` = game complete, process stats

3. **Active bet indicator** (`bet.active`):
   - Server-side state
   - `true` = more actions needed
   - `false` = game ended

**State flow**:
```
Place bet → bet.active=true, cashout_done=false
    ↓
Take action → if bet.active: continue
             if !bet.active: cashout_done=true, process
    ↓
Cashout OR lose → bet.active=false, cashout_done=true
```

**Recovery pattern**:
If `existingGame` error occurs:
1. Call `/_api/casino/active-bet/{game}`
2. Resume from current state
3. Don't count as new bet

**Critical**: Never call `dobet()` callback until `cashout_done=true`.

---

### 5. Win/Loss Determination

**Universal rule**: `payoutMultiplier >= 1.0` = win

**Rationale**:
- Win: `payoutMultiplier > 1` (profit)
- Push: `payoutMultiplier = 1` (break even)
- Loss: `payoutMultiplier < 1` (usually 0)

**Profit calculation**:
```javascript
current_profit = bet.payout - bet.amount
```

Where:
```javascript
bet.payout = bet.amount * bet.payoutMultiplier
```

**Example**:
- Bet: 0.001 BTC
- Win at 2x: payout = 0.002, profit = 0.001
- Loss: payout = 0, profit = -0.001
- Push: payout = 0.001, profit = 0

**Implementation note**: Use `decimal.Decimal` in Go to avoid float precision errors.

---

### 6. Currency Precision

**All amounts use 8 decimal places**:
- Display: `.toFixed(8)`
- Storage: float64 (or decimal.Decimal recommended)
- No scaling to satoshis/wei

**Currency codes**: lowercase strings
- `"btc"`, `"eth"`, `"usdc"`, `"trx"`, `"ltc"`, etc.

**Implementation note**: Use `shopspring/decimal` for accurate financial math:
```go
import "github.com/shopspring/decimal"

amount := decimal.NewFromFloat(0.00000001)
```

---

### 7. Bet Response Structure Inconsistency

**Two response formats exist**:

**Format 1 (REST endpoints)**: Direct game object
```json
{
  "diceRoll": {
    "id": "...",
    "amount": 0.001,
    "payout": 0.002,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Format 2 (GraphQL-style)**: Wrapped in `data`
```json
{
  "data": {
    "diceRoll": {
      "id": "...",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Detection pattern**:
```javascript
const gameType = Object.keys(json)[0] === "data"
  ? Object.keys(json.data)[0]
  : Object.keys(json)[0];
```

**Implementation note**: Your Go client should handle both formats transparently.

---

### 8. HiLo Card Rank Values

**Card ranks**: `"A"`, `"2"` - `"10"`, `"J"`, `"Q"`, `"K"`

**Numeric ordering for HiLo**:
- A = 1 (lowest)
- 2-10 = face value
- J = 11
- Q = 12
- K = 13 (highest)

**Suit values**: `"H"` (hearts), `"D"` (diamonds), `"C"` (clubs), `"S"` (spades)

**Guess types**:
- `"higher"` = next card higher rank
- `"lower"` = next card lower rank
- `"equal"` = next card same rank
- `"higherEqual"` = next card >= current
- `"lowerEqual"` = next card <= current
- `"skip"` = skip current card

**Edge cases**:
- If current = A, "lower" is impossible
- If current = K, "higher" is impossible
- "equal" always low probability (1/13)

---

### 9. No Token Refresh Mechanism

**Critical limitation**: Session tokens expire, but there is NO programmatic refresh mechanism.

**Implications**:
- User must manually provide valid token
- Token extracted from browser cookies
- On authentication failure (401/403):
  - Prompt user to provide fresh token
  - No automatic re-authentication possible

**Mitigation strategies**:
1. Detect token expiry early (test with UserBalances)
2. Show clear error message to user
3. Provide instructions for extracting new token
4. Save token to config file for reuse

**Implementation note**: Desktop app should cache token, but be prepared to re-prompt user.

---

### 10. Mines Field Indexing

**Mines grid**: 5x5 = 25 positions

**Field indices**: 0-24 (zero-indexed)

**Grid layout**:
```
 0  1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14
15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24
```

**Request format**:
```json
{
  "fields": [0, 5, 12, 18]
}
```

**Response includes**:
- `state.mines`: Array of mine positions (only revealed when game ends)
- `state.rounds`: Array of revealed positions with multipliers

**Critical**: Never send duplicate fields. Server may reject or treat as hit mine.

---

### 11. Blackjack Action Availability

**Actions vary by game state**:

Server returns `state.actions` array indicating available actions:
```json
{
  "state": {
    "actions": ["BLACKJACK_HIT", "BLACKJACK_STAND", "BLACKJACK_DOUBLE"]
  }
}
```

**Action mapping**:
- `BLACKJACK_HIT` → `"hit"`
- `BLACKJACK_STAND` → `"stand"`
- `BLACKJACK_DOUBLE` → `"double"`
- `BLACKJACK_SPLIT` → `"split"`
- `BLACKJACK_INSURANCE` → `"insurance"`
- `BLACKJACK_NOINSURANCE` → `"noInsurance"`

**Client must**:
1. Check `state.actions` array
2. Only send actions present in array
3. Sending invalid action likely results in error

**Implementation note**: Validate action against available actions before sending.

---

### 12. Statistics Update Timing

**Statistics are updated AFTER each bet completes**, not continuously.

**Update triggers**:
1. Bet response received
2. Win/loss determined
3. Profit calculated
4. Statistics incremented
5. UI updated

**For multi-round games**: Statistics only update when `cashout_done=true`.

**Implication**: During a 10-round HiLo game, statistics don't change until final cashout.

**Implementation note**: Don't update session stats until bet is fully complete.
