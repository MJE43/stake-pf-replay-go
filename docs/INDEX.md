## Core Documentation

### Development & Guidelines

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** | Repository guidelines for developers and AI agents. Covers project structure, build commands (`wails dev`, `make -C backend dev`), coding style, testing, commit conventions, and security tips. **Start here.** |
| **[codex-cloud-env.md](./codex-cloud-env.md)** | Codex Cloud agent environment setup. Linux build dependencies, agent commands, caching strategies, and troubleshooting. |
| **[ngrok.md](./ngrok.md)** | Guide for exposing local services via ngrok tunnels. Multi-tunnel configuration, cross-OS notes, and security checklist. |

### Product & Architecture

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[PRD.md](./PRD.md)** | Product Requirements Document. High-level overview, user stories, non-functional requirements, API specifications, game verification, scanning performance targets, and milestones. |
| **[stakeDocs.md](./stakeDocs.md)** | Stake.com provably fair specification. RNG implementation details, server/client seeds, nonce handling, bytes-to-floats conversion, game event translation, and Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. **Foundational reference for backend game implementations.** |

### Design Constraints (CI-Enforced)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[design-constraints.md](./design-constraints.md)** | **CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all design decisions. Latency budgets, pagination rules, consistency model, loading patterns, error taxonomy, realtime semantics, and optimistic UI eligibility. **Violations block PRs.** |
| **[generated/ui-implications.md](./generated/ui-implications.md)** | Translation of backend constraints into prescriptive UI patterns. Resource-specific guidance, loading pattern matrix, error handling, and prohibited patterns. Auto-generated from constraints. |
| **[generated/backend-inventory.json](./generated/backend-inventory.json)** | Machine-readable endpoint catalog (30 endpoints). Latency budgets, pagination rules, rate limits, consistency model. Used by the CI validator script. |

### Configuration

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md](./CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md)** | Quick reference for Wails application configuration. Window settings, platform options, security features. |
| **[APPLICATION_OPTIONS_REVIEW.md](./APPLICATION_OPTIONS_REVIEW.md)** | Detailed implementation review of all Wails configuration options. Windows/macOS/Linux platform specifics, testing recommendations. |

### Live Dashboard

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[live-dashboard-strategy-spec.md](./live-dashboard-strategy-spec.md)** | Business logic and UX specification for the live Pump cadence monitoring dashboard. Tier semantics, expected gaps, heartbeat requirements, analytics, and UI requirements. |
| **[antebot-script.js](./antebot-script.js)** | Working example script for Pump game cadence monitoring. Sends heartbeat and bet payloads to live ingest endpoint. Implementation reference for the live dashboard spec. |

## Scripting Engine Documentation

Specifications for implementing a user-scriptable betting automation engine, extracted from bot2love extension analysis.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[scripting/scripting-model.md](./scripting/scripting-model.md)** | Complete scripting engine specification. 70+ global variables, available functions, execution lifecycle, game-specific configuration, example scripts, and Go implementation notes. |
