## Random Number Generation

For each verifiable game, a client seed, a server seed, a nonce and a cursor are used as the input parameters for the [random number generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) function. This function utilises the cryptographic hash function [HMAC\_SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) to generate bytes which are then used as the foundation for how we generate provably fair random outcomes on our platform.

```
// Random number generation based on following inputs: serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce and cursor
function byteGenerator({ serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce, cursor }) {
  // Setup cursor variables
  let currentRound = Math.floor(cursor / 32);
  let currentRoundCursor = cursor;
  currentRoundCursor -= currentRound * 32;

  // Generate outputs until cursor requirement fullfilled
  while (true) {
    // HMAC function used to output provided inputs into bytes
    const hmac = createHmac('sha256', serverSeed);
    hmac.update(\`${clientSeed}:${nonce}:${currentRound}\`);
    const buffer = hmac.digest();

    // Update cursor for next iteration of loop
    while (currentRoundCursor < 32) {
      yield Number(buffer[currentRoundCursor]);
      currentRoundCursor += 1;
    }
    currentRoundCursor = 0;
    currentRound += 1;
  }
}
```

## Server Seed

The server seed is generated by our system as a random 64-character hex string. You are then provided with an encrypted hash of that generated server seed before you play any games. The reason we provide you with the encrypted form of the server seed is to ensure that the un-hashed server seed cannot be changed by the social casino operator, and that the customer cannot calculate the results beforehand.

To reveal the server seed from its hashed version, the seed must be rotated by the customer, which triggers the replacement with a newly generated one.

From this point you are able to verify that the hashed server seed matches that of the un-hashed server seed. This process can be verified via our un-hashed server seed function found in the menu above.

## Client Seed

The client seed belongs to the customer.

All customers are free to edit and change their client seed regularly to create a new chain of random upcoming outcomes.

You can do this via the fairness modal.

## Nonce

The nonce is simply a number that increments as every new game is played.

The implementation of nonce, ensures we remain committed to your client seed and server seed pair, whilst generating new results for each game played.

## Cursor (Incremental Number)

We use 4 bytes of data to generate a single game result, and because SHA256 is limited to 32 bytes, we utilise this implementation of a cursor to give us the ability to create more game events without having to modify our provable fair algorithm.

The cursor is only iterated over when the game being played requires the generation of more than 8 (32 bytes / 4 bytes) possible outcomes. For example: when we need to use more than 8 cards in a game of blackjack.

The cursor starts as 0 and gets increased by 1 every time the 32 bytes are returned by the HMAC\_SHA256 function. If we don’t require more than 8 random numbers to be generated for the game events, then the cursor does not increment as there is no need to generate any additional possible game outcomes.

Games with more than 1 incremental number:

- Hilo (Unlimited to cover required amount of cards)
- Keno (2 increments for every game due to 10 possible outcomes)
- Mines (3 increments per game for 24 possible bomb locations)
- Pump (3 increments per game for 24 possible pop chances)
- Chicken (3 increments per game for 20 possible death chances)
- Plinko (2 increments per game to cover possible 16 decisions)
- Blackjack (Unlimited to cover required amount of cards)
- Video Poker (7 increments to generate 52 possible cards in a full deck)
- Snakes (2 increments for every game due to 10 total dice rolls)
- Slots (The incremental number is only utilised for bonus rounds)
- Flip (3 increments per game for 20 flips)
- Rock Paper Scissors (Unlimited to cover required amount of cards and 3 increments per autobet game to cover 20 max cards)
- Bars (4 increments per game for 30 bars)

Games with only 1 incremental number (represented as default value 0):

- Dice
- Limbo
- Wheel
- Baccarat
- Roulette
- Diamonds
- Cases
- Darts
- Primedice
- Packs




Game events are translation of the randomly generated floats into a relatable outcome that is game specific. This includes anything from the outcome of a dice roll to the order of the cards in a deck, or even the location of every bomb in a game of mines.

Below is a detailed explanation as to how we translate floats into events for each particular different game on our platform.

## Blackjack, Hilo & Baccarat

In a standard deck of cards, there are 52 unique possible outcomes. When it comes to playing Blackjack, Hilo & Baccarat on our platform, we utilise an unlimited amount of decks when generating the game event, and therefore each turn of a card always has the same probability. To calculate this, we multiply each randomly generated float by 52, and then translate that result into a particular card, based on the following index:

```
// Index of 0 to 51 : ♦2 to ♣A
const CARDS = [ 
  ♦2, ♥2, ♠2, ♣2, ♦3, ♥3, ♠3, ♣3, ♦4, ♥4,  
  ♠4, ♣4, ♦5, ♥5, ♠5, ♣5, ♦6, ♥6, ♠6, ♣6, 
  ♦7, ♥7, ♠7, ♣7, ♦8, ♥8, ♠8, ♣8, ♦9, ♥9, 
  ♠9, ♣9, ♦10, ♥10, ♠10, ♣10, ♦J, ♥J, ♠J, 
  ♣J, ♦Q, ♥Q, ♠Q, ♣Q, ♦K, ♥K, ♠K, ♣K, ♦A, 
  ♥A, ♠A, ♣A 
]; 

// Game event translation
const card = CARDS[Math.floor(float * 52)];
```

The only differentiating factor involved with these games is that with **Hilo** and **Blackjack** there is a cursor of 13 to generate 52 possible game events for cases where a large amount of cards are required to be dealt to the customer, whereas when it comes to **Baccarat** we only ever need 6 game events generated to cover the most amount of playable cards possible.

## Bars

In a game of Bars, 30 random floats between 0.0 and 1.0 are generated and used as the probability to select the winning bar from a predefined winnings table. This winnings table can be found at the footer of the Bars game and in the provable fairness verification calculation page.

## Cases

In a Cases game, a single random float between 0.0 and 1.0 is generated, which is used as the probability to select the winning case from a predefined winnings table. This winnings table can be found at the footer of the Cases game and in the provable fairness verification calculation page.

## Packs

In a Packs game, five random floats between 0.0 and 1.0 are generated, one for each card in the pack. Each float is used as the probability to select a card from a predefined winnings table containing 240 unique cards with different multipliers and rarities. This winnings table can be found at the footer of the Packs game and in the provable fairness verification calculation page.

Each of the 5 floats is independently mapped to a card using cumulative probability ranges, allowing for the possibility of receiving duplicate cards of the same rarity or multiplier within a single pack opening.

## Darts

In a Darts game, two random float between 0.0 and 1.0 are generated, which are used as the distance and rotation to position the dart on the board. The rotation value is represented by 0.0 being the top of the dartboard, 0.5 being the bottom, and 1.0 wrapping back to the top. The distance value is normalized with sqrt(float) / 2, and is the distance from the center from 0.0 to 0.5, with 0.0 being the center and 0.5 being the edge of the board.

## Flip

A Flip game generates 20 separate game events, each representing the result of a coin flip. For each coin flip, if the value of the float is less than or equal to 0.5, the result is "tails", otherwise it is "heads".

## Snakes

In a Snakes game, 10 dice rolls are generated between integer values 1 and 6. The values are added together for each round for a total of 5 pairs of six sided dice rolls per round.

## Diamonds

When playing Diamonds, there is 7 possible outcomes in the form of gems. To achieve this, we multiply each float generated by 7 before it is translated into a corresponding gem using the following index:

```
// Index of 0 to 6 : green to blue
const GEMS = [ green, purple, yellow, red, cyan, pink, blue ];

// Game event translation
const gem = GEMS[Math.floor(float * 7)];
```

The customer is then dealt 5 gems.

## Dice Roll

In our version of dice, we cover a possible roll spread of 00.00 to 100.00, which has a range of 10,001 possible outcomes. The game event translation is done by multiplying the float by number of possible outcomes and then dividing by 100 so that the resulting number fits the constraints of our stated dice range.

```
// Game event translation
const roll = (float * 10001) / 100;
```

## Primedice

Primedice uses the same dice roll mechanism as the regular Dice game, covering a possible roll spread of 00.00 to 100.00, which has a range of 10,001 possible outcomes. The game event translation is done by multiplying the float by number of possible outcomes and then dividing by 100 so that the resulting number fits the constraints of our stated dice range. The difference with Primedice is that it allows for more complex playing conditions including rolling between two numbers, rolling outside a range, or rolling between two pairs of numbers.

```
// Game event translation
const roll = (float * 10001) / 100;
```

## Limbo

When it comes to Limbo, we use a two-step process. Firstly, we take the float and multiply it by both the maximum possible multiplier and the house edge. Then, in order to generate a game event that has [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution), we divide the maximum possible multiplier by the result of the first step to create the game event in the form of a crash point.

```
// Game event translation with houseEdge of 0.99 (1%)
const floatPoint = 1e8 / (float * 1e8) * houseEdge;

// Crash point rounded down to required denominator
const crashPoint = Math.floor(floatPoint * 100) / 100;

// Consolidate all crash points below 1
const result = Math.max(crashPoint, 1);
```

## Plinko

For any game of Plinko, the generated outcome is based on the path of the falling ball. The game event determines the direction of the falling ball for each level in the falling process. Customers can choose between 8 and 16 pins of play, which determines the number of game events required to generate a complete path from top to bottom. Since there are only two possible directions (left or right) the translation is done by multiplying each float by 2, which maps to the following index:

```
// Index of 0 to 1 : left to right
const DIRECTIONS = [ left, right ];

// Game event translation
const direction = CARDS[Math.floor(float * 2)];
```

## Roulette Roll

Our Roulette is derived from the European version of the game where the wheel consists of 37 possible different pockets, ranging from 0 to 36. The game event is calculated by multiplying the float by 37 and then translated into a corresponding pocket using the following index:

```
// Index of 0 to 36
const POCKETS = [ 
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 
  20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 
  30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36
];
  
// Game event translation
const pocket = POCKETS[Math.floor(float * 37)];
```

## Keno

Traditional Keno games require the selection of 10 possible game events in the form of hits on a board. To achieve this, we multiply each float by the number of possible unique squares that exist. Once a hit has been placed, it cannot be chosen again, which changes the pool size of the possible outcomes. This is done by subtracting the size of possible maximum outcomes by 1 for each iteration of game event result generated using the corresponding float provided, using the following index:

```
// Index of 0 to 39 : 1 to 40
const SQUARES = [ 
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
  21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
  31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40
];
  
const hit = SQUARES[Math.floor(float * 40)];
```

The fisher-yates shuffle implementation is utilised to prevent duplicate possible hits being generated.

## Mines

A mine game is generated with 24 separate game events, in the form of mines on the board. Each float is multiplied by the number of possible unique tiles still remaining on the board. This is done by subtracting the number of tiles remaining by 1 for each iteration of game event result generated using the corresponding float provided. The location of the mine is plotted using a grid position from left to right, top to bottom.

The fisher-yates shuffle implementation is utilised to prevent duplicate possible hits being generated. Between 1 and 24 game event results are used, based on the settings chosen.

## Pump

A Pump game is generated with 24 separate game events, in the form of pops at each round. Each float is multiplied by the number of rounds remaining. This is done by subtracting the number of rounds remaining by 1 for each pump.

The fisher-yates shuffle implementation is utilised to prevent duplicate possible hits being generated. Between 1 and 24 game event results are used, based on the settings chosen.

## Chicken

A Chicken game is generated with 20 separate game events, in the form of deaths at each round. Each float is multiplied by the number of rounds remaining. This is done by subtracting the number of rounds remaining by 1 for each step.

The fisher-yates shuffle implementation is utilised to prevent duplicate possible hits being generated. Between 1 and 20 game event results are used, based on the settings chosen.

## Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors rounds are generated individually for an unlimited number of rounds, except for in autoplay which is limited to 20 max rounds. A number between 0 and 2 is generated for each round and assigned to rock (0), paper (1) or scissors (2).

## Video Poker

A video poker game involves 52 separate game events, in the form of cards in a deck. Each float is multiplied by the number of possible cards still remaining in the deck. This is done by subtracting the number of cards remaining by 1 for each iteration of game event result generated using the corresponding float provided. This is done by selecting a card from the following index:

```
// Index of 0 to 51 : ♦2 to ♣A
const CARDS = [ 
  ♦2, ♥2, ♠2, ♣2, ♦3, ♥3, ♠3, ♣3, ♦4, ♥4,  
  ♠4, ♣4, ♦5, ♥5, ♠5, ♣5, ♦6, ♥6, ♠6, ♣6, 
  ♦7, ♥7, ♠7, ♣7, ♦8, ♥8, ♠8, ♣8, ♦9, ♥9, 
  ♠9, ♣9, ♦10, ♥10, ♠10, ♣10, ♦J, ♥J, ♠J, 
  ♣J, ♦Q, ♥Q, ♠Q, ♣Q, ♦K, ♥K, ♠K, ♣K, ♦A, 
  ♥A, ♠A, ♣A 
]; 

// Game event translation
const card = CARDS[Math.floor(float * 52)];
```

The fisher-yates shuffle implementation is utilised to prevent duplicate cards being generated.

## Wheel

The game event number is calculated by multiplying the float by the possible outcomes in the segment. It is then used to determine the game event result as a multiplier, using the following index:

```
// Index per payout configuration
const PAYOUTS = {
  '10': {
    low: [ 1.5, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 0, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 0 ],

## Scarab Spin / Tome of Life

The game event number is calculated by multiplying the float by the possible outcomes in the reel. The first 4 reels have a length of 30 possible outcomes, whilst the last reel has 41. The game event determines the central stop position for each reel. This game consists of 5 game event numbers, until the case of a bonus round, where more are generated.

## Blue Samurai

Blue Samurai slots has 3 different types of spins. Regular, bonus and special.

For regular and bonus spins, 18 floats from 0 to 1 are generated from your hash. Unlike Scarab Spin slots, which has fixed reels, Samurai slots has dynamic reels, meaning each symbol is generated from the corresponding float that was assigned to it.

We use weighted random sampling to assign each float to its corresponding tile, in the same order, moving down the reels, from left to right. Each symbol has its own fixed probability / chance of appearing in any one tile, with the outer 2 reels having a different set of probabilities to the inner 3 reels. For a bit more information on how symbols are selected, see [fitness proportionate selection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection) to learn more.

Special spins are slightly different. For a start only 12 floats are taken from your hash, as the outer reels are disabled. Between each special spin, any samurai symbols stay in place for the remainder of the game, with the result being the final count of samurais. This means that if you were to have for example 1 samurai stick in the first spin - we'd technically only need 11 floats for the subsequent spin. For the sake of simplicity in the probably fair model, we just generate 12 floats every time, and if the float that was allocated for a tile has a stuck samurai from a previous spin, then that float is not used at all.

## Dragon Tower

A Dragon Tower game is generated with 9 separate game events, in the form of the levels up the tower. We generate a number of eggs depending on the difficulty for each level, and have a range of tiles the egg can be on also represented by an integer.

Each float generated is then converted to integers to determine the egg location on each row. For example: A level on difficulty easy would be represented like this: \[0, 1, 3\] - eggs would be present at tile 1 and 2 and 4.

```
// count represents the number of eggs
// size represents the number of possible squares

const LEVEL_MAP = {
  easy: { count: 3, size: 4 },
  medium: { count: 2, size: 3 },
  hard: { count: 1, size: 2 },
  expert: { count1, size: 3 },
  master: { count: 1, size: 4 },
}
```

The fisher-yates shuffle implementation is utilised to prevent duplicate eggs on a row.

## Bytes to Floats

The output of the Random Number Generator (byteGenerator) function is a hexadecimal 32-byte hash. As explained under the cursor implementation, we use 4 bytes of data to generate a single game result. Each set of 4 bytes are used to generate floats between 0 and 1 (4 bytes are used instead of one to ensure a higher level of precision when generating the float.) It is with these generated floats that we derive the formal output of the provable fair algorithm before it is translated into game events.

```
// Convert the hash output from the rng byteGenerator to floats
function generateFloats ({ serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce, cursor, count }) {
  // Random number generator function
  const rng = byteGenerator({ serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce, cursor });
  // Declare bytes as empty array
  const bytes = [];

  // Populate bytes array with sets of 4 from RNG output
  while (bytes.length < count * 4) {
    bytes.push(rng.next().value);
  }

  // Return bytes as floats using lodash reduce function
  return _.chunk(bytes, 4).map(bytesChunk =>
    bytesChunk.reduce((result, value, i) => {
      const divider = 256 ** (i + 1);
      const partialResult = value / divider;
      return result + partialResult;
    }, 0)
  );
};
```

## Floats to Game Events

Where the process of generating random outputs is universal for all our games, it's at this point in the game outcome generation where a unique procedure is implemented to determine the translation from floats to game events.

The randomly float generated is multiplied by the possible remaining outcomes of the particular game being played. For example: In a game that uses a 52 card deck, this would simply be done by multiplying the float by 52. The result of this equation is then translated into a corresponding game event. For games where multiple game events are required, this process continues through each corresponding 4 bytes in the result chain that was generated using the described byteGenerator function.

## Shuffle of Game Events

For games such as Keno, Mines, Pump, Chicken and Video Poker, where outcomes cannot be duplicated, we then utilise the [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) algorithm. This procedure influences the conversion process from floats to game events because each time a game event is translated, the amount of possible remaining game event possibilities has been reduced for any remaining steps in the result chain.

As an example, in video poker, there is at first 52 cards available in the complete deck, and therefore the first game event is translated by multiplying the float by 52. Once this card has been dealt, there is only 51 remaining cards in the deck, and therefore the second card translation is done by multiplying the second float generated by 51. This continues in the same fashion until all the game events required have been generated.

With regards to Mines, Pump, Chicken and Keno, this is simply a matter of implementing the same process as explained with video poker but changing that to tiles or locations on the board or grid, ensuring that each game event generated, hasn’t already been done so beforehand in the chain of results.
